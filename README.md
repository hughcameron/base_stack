## Troubleshooting

Be sure to set Universal SSL to Full (strict) otherwise the HTTPS redirect will return a browser error - too many redirects as described [here on Cloudflare docs](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170516-How-do-I-add-SSL-to-my-site-).

Note that SSL changes may take 24 hours to take effect.# base_stack
